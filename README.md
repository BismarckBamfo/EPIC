# os

Small kernel/OS experiment with the goal of running a precompiled 64-bit Linux ELF executable of `echo` to learn what it takes to make such an OS.

Kernel can currently only run in 32-bit protected mode on x86 (i386) machine.

Development is sometimes streamed on [my Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/nuffleee).
